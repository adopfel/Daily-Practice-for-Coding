# Daily Practice for Coding

This is a record of all my coding practice including Data Manipulation, Data Structure and Algorithm, Data Visualization.

This is a list of all the practice:
* [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Manipulation%20Practice)
* [Data Structure and Algorithm](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/LeetCode_Algorithm%20and%20Data%20Structure)
* [Data Visualization](https://github.com/lush9516/Daily-Practice-for-Coding/tree/master/Data%20Visualization) 

## Data Manipulation
This part contains the following contents:
* Rewtiring SQL queries using Python codes (mainly `pandas` package). Here is the related [blog](https://medium.com/swlh/reproducing-sql-queries-in-python-codes-35d90f716b1a).
* Data Manipulation using `pandas` and `numpy` packages. Here is the related [blog](https://medium.com/swlh/exhaustive-introduction-to-pandas-in-python-cdfd9d3846f2).
* Other techniques, such as web scraping, wordcloud, etc.

## Data Visualization
This part contains my practice on data visualization using `matplotlib` , `seaborn` packages in Python.

## Data Structure and Algorithm
This part contains my practice records on Data Structure and Algorithm using Leetcode questions.
